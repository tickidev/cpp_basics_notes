# C++ Basics - Notes

Welcome to my **C++ Basics** repository! ðŸŽ‰

I am a beginner in C++ and currently learning the fundamentals of the language. This repository contains my personal notes, exercises, and code examples as I go through the basic concepts of C++ programming.

### What you'll find here:

- **Variables**: Understanding different types of variables (e.g., `int`, `float`, `char`, etc.) and how to use them.
- **Functions**: Learning about function declaration, definition, and calling functions with different return types.
- **Control Flow**: Exploring conditional statements (`if`, `else`, `switch`) and control flow structures (`break`, `continue`, `return`).
- **Loops**: Getting comfortable with loop structures like `for`, `while`, and `do-while`.
- **Header Files**: Understanding how header files work and how to organize code into `.h` and `.cpp` files.
- **C++ Syntax**: Basic syntax and formatting practices to make code readable and maintainable.

### My Learning Approach:
This repository serves as a **learning journal** where I document my progress and understanding of C++. All of the code and explanations here are for personal reference, and you might find comments or code that reflect my learning curve as I explore C++ for the first time.

### Note:
Since I am still learning, the code in this repository may not be perfect. I welcome any feedback and suggestions for improvement. As I progress, I'll update and expand the notes, so feel free to check back later.

### Files Overview:
- **`main.cpp`**: Contains basic examples of C++ concepts.
- **`calc.h` and `calc.cpp`**: Examples of header and source files, showing function declaration and definition.
- **Other files**: Various files that explain different C++ concepts.
